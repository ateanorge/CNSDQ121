## Start Visual Studio workspace from folder in WSL2

In the WSL terminal, make sure you are in the helloWorld folder, and type in 'code .' to launch Visual Studio Code. The '.' argument tells VS Code to open the current folder.
Note: If this command does not work, you may need to restart your terminal, or you may not have added VS Code to your path when it was installed.
